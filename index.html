    <H4>Maturity is not a matter of age, but instead, it’s how you choose to respond and react to various life situations.</H4>
       <p>It is essentially a level of mental development or wisdom that has a bearing on all areas of an individual’s life, right from their conduct to their relationship with others.</p>
        
        <p>A person’s age does not have anything to do with their maturity. Many young people are wise and mature for their age, and some older people are still immature and childish.</p>
